# About Coneato V2.0
Coneato v2.0 is an exciting twist on the classic TicTacToe game, featuring strategic stacking mechanics with colorful cones. Players compete to create a line of three cones while managing their inventory and strategically placing cones on the grid.

# Game Rules
Two Teams:
Team Blue (A) and Team Red (B) compete against each other.
Each team starts with 4 cones of sizes 1 to 4 in their inventory.

# Cone Placement:

A cone can only be placed on:
An empty cell.
A cone from the opponent‚Äôs team, if it‚Äôs smaller than the cone being placed.
You cannot place a cone on top of your own team‚Äôs cone.
Inventory Management:

After placing the 4th cone, the team‚Äôs oldest top cone disappears and returns to the inventory.
If you cover an opponent‚Äôs cone, the opponent‚Äôs cone reappears in their inventory.
No Phantom Cones:

Ensure that no ‚Äúphantom‚Äù cone remains hidden under the stack. Only the top cone matters for gameplay.
Win Condition:

The first team to get 3 in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) of their top cones wins the game.


# Website Layout
Mobile-Friendly:

The game is optimized for mobile devices, with no scrolling required.
The grid and inventories adjust to fit the screen perfectly.
